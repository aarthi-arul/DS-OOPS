'''Polymorphism is an ability (in OOP) to use a common interface for multiple forms (data types).
Suppose, we need to color a shape, there are multiple shape options (rectangle, square, circle). However we could use the same method to color any shape. This concept is called Polymorphism.'''

class Parrot:
    def fly(self):
        print("Parrot can fly")
    
    def swim(self):
        print("Parrot can't swim")

class Penguin:
    def fly(self):
        print("Penguin can't fly")
    
    def swim(self):
        print("Penguin can swim")

# common interface
def flying_test(bird):
    bird.fly()

#instantiate objects
blu = Parrot()
peggy = Penguin()
# passing the object
flying_test(blu)
flying_test(peggy)

Output
Parrot can fly
Penguin can't fly

'''In the above program, we defined two classes Parrot and Penguin. Each of them have a common fly() method. However, their functions are different.
To use polymorphism, we created a common interface i.e flying_test() function that takes any object and calls the object's fly() method. 
Thus, when we passed the blu and peggy objects in the flying_test() function, it ran effectively.'''
